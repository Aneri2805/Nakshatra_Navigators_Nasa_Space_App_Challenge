We have Uploaded our Broucher with the file name "Tour_Broucher_final.pdf" from this google drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1__Zeg36X9EqqEhP1r0CBGhJ6Kx9OvPuE.

We tried to customise User's Tours according to there preferences of traveling Date using "DateEstimation.txt" code in python but due to limitation of secure SSH We couldn't implement it in our website.

We have uploaded video of Demo of our project in "Demo.mp4".
